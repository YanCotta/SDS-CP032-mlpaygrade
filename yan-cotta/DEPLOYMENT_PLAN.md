# Production Deployment Plan

**MLPayGrade Advanced Track - Final Deployment Roadmap**

## Overview

This document outlines the next steps for deploying the MLPayGrade salary prediction model to a production environment. The current state includes a finalized, leak-proof XGBoost pipeline with realistic performance metrics and a Streamlit application for user interaction.

## Current State

âœ… **Complete:**
- Leak-proof XGBoost pipeline with sklearn Pipeline architecture
- Temporal validation (2020-2022 train, 2023 val, 2024 test)
- Realistic performance metrics (Test MAE: ~$48.5K)
- Streamlit application with uncertainty quantification
- Comprehensive documentation and ceiling analysis

## Production Deployment Checklist

### 1. Containerization
- [ ] **Create Dockerfile**: Containerize the Streamlit application and its dependencies
  - [ ] Base image: `python:3.12-slim` or similar
  - [ ] Install requirements from `requirements.txt`
  - [ ] Copy application code and model artifacts
  - [ ] Expose port 8501 for Streamlit
  - [ ] Set appropriate health checks

- [ ] **Docker Compose Setup**: For local development and testing
  - [ ] Define services for the application
  - [ ] Include volume mounts for development
  - [ ] Environment variable configuration

- [ ] **Requirements Management**: 
  - [ ] Pin all dependencies to specific versions
  - [ ] Include model artifacts in container or external storage
  - [ ] Optimize image size (multi-stage builds if needed)

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Set up `.github/workflows/main.yml`
  - [ ] **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
  - [ ] **Steps**:
    - [ ] Checkout code
    - [ ] Set up Python environment
    - [ ] Install dependencies
    - [ ] Run linter (flake8, black, or ruff)
    - [ ] Run basic tests (if available)
    - [ ] Build Docker image
    - [ ] Push Docker image to container registry

- [ ] **Container Registry**: 
  - [ ] GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) setup
  - [ ] Docker Hub alternative
  - [ ] Tag images with commit SHA and latest

- [ ] **Quality Gates**:
  - [ ] Code linting passes
  - [ ] Security scanning (if applicable)
  - [ ] Docker image builds successfully
  - [ ] Basic smoke tests

### 3. Cloud Deployment Options

#### Option A: Streamlit Community Cloud (Recommended for Demo)
- [ ] **Setup**: Deploy directly from GitHub repository
- [ ] **Configuration**: 
  - [ ] Ensure model artifacts are included in repo (or downloadable)
  - [ ] Set up secrets for any API keys
  - [ ] Configure Python version and dependencies
- [ ] **Benefits**: Free, easy setup, automatic deployments

#### Option B: Hugging Face Spaces
- [ ] **Setup**: Create Streamlit Space
- [ ] **Configuration**:
  - [ ] Upload model artifacts to Hugging Face Hub
  - [ ] Configure space with requirements
  - [ ] Set up automatic updates from GitHub
- [ ] **Benefits**: ML-focused platform, good performance

#### Option C: Cloud VM Deployment
- [ ] **Platform Selection**: AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute, Azure VM
- [ ] **Setup Steps**:
  - [ ] Provision appropriate VM size (2-4 GB RAM minimum)
  - [ ] Install Docker and Docker Compose
  - [ ] Set up reverse proxy (nginx) for SSL termination
  - [ ] Configure domain and SSL certificates
  - [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

#### Option D: Container Service
- [ ] **Platform Options**: 
  - [ ] AWS ECS/Fargate
  - [ ] Google Cloud Run
  - [ ] Azure Container Instances
- [ ] **Configuration**:
  - [ ] Set up service with appropriate CPU/memory limits
  - [ ] Configure auto-scaling policies
  - [ ] Set up load balancing if needed
  - [ ] Implement health checks

### 4. Production Considerations

#### Security
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement to prevent abuse
- [ ] **HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Regular security updates for all packages

#### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Application Logs**: Structured logging with appropriate levels
- [ ] **Metrics**: Track prediction requests, response times, errors
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Endpoint for container orchestration
- [ ] **Alerting**: Set up alerts for application errors or high latency

#### Performance
- [ ] **Model Loading**: Cache model artifacts for faster startup
- [ ] **Response Time**: Optimize prediction pipeline for sub-second responses
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate CPU/memory limits
- [ ] **Caching**: Consider caching common predictions

#### Data & Model Management
- [ ] **Model Versioning**: Track which model version is deployed
- [ ] **Model Updates**: Process for deploying new model versions
- [ ] **Data Storage**: If persistence is needed, set up appropriate database
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: For model artifacts and any persistent data

### 5. Testing Strategy

#### Pre-Deployment Testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: For feature engineering functions
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end prediction pipeline
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Simulate concurrent users
- [ ] **UI Tests**: Ensure Streamlit interface works correctly

#### Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] **Smoke Tests**: Verify deployment is functional
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Confirm response times meet requirements
- [ ] **Functionality Tests**: Verify predictions are reasonable
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Process for reverting to previous version if needed

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Demo Deployment (1-2 days)
1. Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud for immediate demo
2. Basic CI/CD for automatic updates
3. Documentation updates with live demo link

### Phase 2: Production-Grade Deployment (1-2 weeks)
1. Containerize application
2. Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
3. Deploy to cloud platform with proper monitoring
4. Implement security and performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Optional)
1. A/B testing framework for model improvements
2. User feedback collection
3. Advanced analytics and monitoring
4. API endpoint for programmatic access
